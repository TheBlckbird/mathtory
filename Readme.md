This is a tiny example of the logic behind factory builders.

I might do some more with this in the future, but for now it only was a small experiment.

You can change the buildings in [main.rs](/src/main.rs) and add new ones in [building.rs](/src/building.rs).  
The structure should be clear when looking at the examples in the code.

Have fun :]
